Why add a load balancer?


Load balancing:
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic equally among multiple servers. This ensures that each server receives its fair share of requests, causing a specific server to become overloaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Performance Improvement:
By distributing the load, a load balancer can improve the overall performance of the system. Users benefit from faster response times because their requests are distributed efficiently.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High availability:
A load balancer can be configured to redirect traffic to backup servers in the event of a server failure. This ensures continuous availability of the service, minimizing downtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traffic management:
Load balancers can intelligently manage traffic based on routing rules, server health, and other factors. This makes it possible to optimize the management of requests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security:
Load balancers can also act as an application firewall, filtering and blocking malicious traffic before it reaches servers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scalability:
By adding more servers, the infrastructure can easily be scaled to handle increased traffic, providing horizontal scalability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In summary, adding a load balancer is essential to ensure optimal performance, continuous availability, balanced load distribution and better traffic management, while strengthening the security of the web infrastructure.
